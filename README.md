Designed a personal portfolio to present my work, compatible across a variety of devices. It uses a few hosted services for typography, background effects, and image optimization.
The porfolio features an organized layout and a consistent color system. It includes a brief intro and project summaries about my work as a computer scientist, with links to social 
profiles and more details on the ideas.
